## Description
`mypackage` provides tools for dataset analysis—such as computing correlations and survival rates—and corresponding visualizations. It primarily utilizes the "titanic" dataset from the seaborn library.

The package comprises two classes, each containing approximately 6–7 functions. The **Analyzer** class is designed for data analysis and can process any dataset, although one function is specifically optimized for the "titanic" dataset.

The **Visualizer** class is responsible for creating plots and visual representations of the analysis. Some functions in this class accept outputs from the Analyzer, while others can operate independently based on user-defined parameters.

Additionally to the two classes, there is a helper file **organize_data** which edits the given dataset-for example by deleting two duplicate rows and filling in missing age values with the average age of men and women. Finally the cleaned dataset is saved as a new **cleaned_data.csv** file. 

## Installation

```console
pip install mypackage
```
